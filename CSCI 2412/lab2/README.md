The purpose for this lab was to sort of get our feet wet with a little bit of PHP coding as well
as some more Git. 

In this lab we experimented with variables, the echo statement, operators, and if/elseif/else statements, 

At the end of the lab we were then tasked with creating a program that checks whether or not a number is divisble by 3, 5, or both. (diy.php)
