The purpose of this folder is to highlight the skills developed during labs 3 and 4. 

Lab 3 comprised of learning about arrays, loops (for, foreach, while), functions, exceptions, and Try/Catch/Finally blocks. (see arrays.php, exceptions.php, functions.php, and loops.php)

For the DIY section of the lab, we were tasked with creating a function that accepts an input, mulitplys the input by 37, and then echos out to the user the equation plus the answer. 
The code also throws in some exceptions handling that prevents the user from inputting strings or booleans. Basically anything that is not a number. 
As a chaleenge, we were also tasked with listing all of the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5 and printing out the sum of those numbers. 
----------------------------------------------------------

Lab 4 is also encompassed in the lab 3 folder due to it feeding off of lab 3. 

In lab 4, we learned about Object-Oriented programming and how to implement it while coding in PHP along wiht learnign about methods, getters and setters, and constructors and destructors. 
We also learned a little about access modifiers and inheritance.
