Classes I will probably need for my final project. 
1) Something that takes the username and password and saves it for a user. 
	- Have a method that allows the user to create a new username and
		password but will throw an error if the password or username doesn't live up to specifications. 
2) A shopping cart class that allows the user to put in objects that they want to buy
	- Could possibly make an array of objects
3) A user login class
4) Some sort of class that allows desktop users to switch between a light and a "dark mode"
	that fits with the theme of Five Nights At Freddy's.
