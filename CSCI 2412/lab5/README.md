The purpose for this exercise was to learn how to successfully integrate PHP into HTML by creating a simple webpage. 
During this lab we also integrated the two subjects with object-oriented programming and learned how to create basic forms in php and prevent cross site scripting with input sanitization with form validation. 

For the DIY section of the lab (fuelCalculator.php), we were tasked with creating a calculator that would calculate how much a user should budget for the weekly cost of gas by
using a form wiht input fields. The program also would calculate discounts based on fuel perks that the user gained from shopping for the week.
